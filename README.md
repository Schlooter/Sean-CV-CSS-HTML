# Sean-CV-CSS-HTML
After trying to upload 4 times and not being able to get CSS file to load. The fouth time worked only after I discovered the path to the css file from the index.html wasnt correct. Needed the characters "css" capitalized. I also discovered the images were not loading also because of incorrect path from index.html. Path needed to reflect loading from github and not my personal files.
